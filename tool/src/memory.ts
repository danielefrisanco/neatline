/**
 * What the browser remembers between visits.
 *
 * The URL is the whole of a map's state and that is right for sharing and
 * wrong for coming back: a reader who closes the tab loses whatever they were
 * making. So the last query string is kept, and a bare address reopens it.
 *
 * **A shared link always wins.** Someone opening a link you sent them is asking
 * for your map, not for the last one they made themselves — so the stored state
 * is only consulted when the address carries nothing at all. That single rule is
 * what keeps "arriving from a link" and "coming back tomorrow" from fighting
 * over the same page.
 *
 * And because a bare address then stops meaning "a blank map", there has to be
 * a way back to one. That is what `forget()` and the *Start over* button are:
 * restoring silently with no way out is a trap, not a convenience.
 *
 * Everything here is wrapped, and not defensively for its own sake. Reading
 * `localStorage` *throws* — not returns null, throws — in a browser set to
 * block site data, and it is empty in a private window. Neither is an error
 * worth showing anyone: the answer to both is a default map, drawn immediately.
