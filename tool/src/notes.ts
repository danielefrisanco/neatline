 * What you asked for and did not get, said next to the control you asked with.
 *
 * The status line under the map was the right place for the only failure the
 * tool had when it was written: a missing data file, which is the deploy's
 * fault and nobody's decision. It is the wrong place for these, which are
 * neither failures nor the deploy's: ticking *Glaciers* over Spain, turning on
 * sea names where none fit, numbering a graticule on a globe whose lines end on
 * the limb. Nothing is broken. The control simply had nothing to do, and it
 * still looks exactly like a control that worked.
 *
 * **Read back off the drawn map, never predicted.** Every one of these is
 * answered by looking at the SVG that was actually produced — did a glacier
 * path get emitted, did a sea name survive the label solver — rather than by a
 * second copy of the library's rules living in the tool. A prediction is a
 * thing that can disagree with the map, and a note that disagrees with the map
 * is worse than no note. The gallery took the same bargain in Phase 2, for the
 * same reason.
 *
 * A hidden label counts as absent, deliberately. `data-fit="0"` means the
 * solver kept the name in the document and declined to show it — which from the
 * reader's side is precisely "I turned this on and cannot see it".
