/**
 * What to export, at what size, and what to call it.
 *
 * Deliberately free of the DOM, and not for tidiness. The library's own
 * `tsconfig` compiles `src` and `test` with `lib: ["ES2022"]` and no DOM at
 * all — which is right, because a map library that can only run in a browser is
 * a different product. A test that reaches into a module holding `document`
 * drags that module into the library's typecheck, where every browser global is
 * an error. So the decisions live here, where they can be tested, and the
 * browser work lives in `raster.ts`, where it cannot be.
 *
 * **Size belongs to the export, not to the screen.** A map re-renders at any
 * size because it is geometry rather than pixels, so a preview sized to a
 * browser column and a poster at 4000 pixels are the same document twice —
 * which makes offering both nearly free, and makes not offering it a waste of
 * the one advantage vector has. It is also why the multiplier here is the
 * *raster's* alone: an SVG has no size, and naming one `1920x1240` would be a
 * claim about it that is not true.
