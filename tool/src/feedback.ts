/**
 * The way back, from somebody who made a map to whoever built the tool.
 *
 * Everything else in this project is one-way. The library emits a document, the
 * tool emits a picture, and a reader who wanted something that is not here has
 * had nowhere to say so — which means every "is this worth building" question
 * the plan has asked has been answered by judgement, because there was no other
 * way to answer it. Roads are the sharpest case: 29 MB of data whose gate is
 * written as *the tool is where anyone will first ask for a road, and asking is
 * the evidence*, in a tool where nobody could ask.
 *
 * **The map travels with the message, and that is the whole point of putting
 * this here rather than on a contact page.** 09c made the address bar the
 * complete state of a map; this is the second thing that property pays for.
 * Somebody reporting that sea names look wrong in the Aegean sends the Aegean,
 * and it reopens exactly as they had it — not a description of it, which is the
 * difference between a bug report and a reproduction.
 *
 * **A form rather than a GitHub issue**, decided against the obvious option: an
 * issue asks the reader for an account before they are allowed to say anything,
 * and the reader this tool was built for — a reporter on deadline — does not
 * have one and will not make one. It also puts their words on a public page,
 * which is wrong for somebody who only wants to say the thing is broken.
 *
 * **The access key below is public and has to be**, because the browser is what
 * does the sending. Web3Forms says so themselves and puts it in a plain hidden
 * input in their own examples. It is not a credential: everything it can do is
 * send an email to the one address it was issued for. It cannot read what was
 * sent before, reach an account, or deliver anywhere else. An `.env` file would
 * not change any of that — Vite inlines `VITE_` variables into the bundle at
 * build time, so it would ship in the JavaScript regardless, and the only thing
 * gained would be the feeling of a secret plus a variable to configure in CI.
 *
 * What the key does expose is an **abuse handle**: anyone can lift it and post
 * to it from their own script, without ever loading this page. The honeypot
 * below does nothing about that — it only catches bots that crawl and submit
 * the form itself — and it is worth being clear about which of the two problems
 * each guard actually solves. The ceiling on the damage is a dead channel until
 * the month turns over, because a free tier refuses rather than bills.
