/**
 * Everything the tool can be told, and the URL it turns into.
 *
 * **The URL is written in this sub-phase rather than a later one on purpose.**
 * State threaded through afterwards has to be retrofitted into every control at
 * once; doing it while there is one control is nearly free. It is also the
 * feature that makes the tool worth having — a map somebody made is a link they
 * can send, and a link that rebuilds it exactly is the difference between a
 * toy and a tool.
 *
 * Two rules keep the links short and readable:
 *
 * - **Only what differs from the default is written.** A fresh page has a bare
 *   URL, and a shared one carries exactly the decisions its author made. It
 *   also means a default can change later without stranding old links on values
 *   nobody chose.
 * - **Keys are short but not cryptic.** These end up in a browser's address bar
 *   where someone will read them, and `proj=albers` explains itself in a way
 *   `p=4` does not.
 *
 * **What a URL cannot carry, said plainly:** a caller-supplied GeoJSON region
 * has no short form, and the tool does not pretend otherwise — the region here
 * is a preset name or a list of ISO codes, both of which fit in a query string.
 * The library still takes GeoJSON; the *tool* is what declines to encode it.
 *
 * Marks — the highlights, pins, arrows and routes a pointer places — extend
 * this through {@link Marks}, and carry their own encoder. They are the first
 * state here that is a *list* rather than one value against one default, which
 * is the whole reason they are encoded somewhere else.
