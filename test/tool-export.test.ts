/**
 * The two halves of an export that are decided before a browser is involved.
 *
 * Rasterising needs a canvas and cannot be tested here; choosing what to
 * rasterise and what to call the result can, and both have a failure that only
 * shows up on somebody's disk. A size past the browser's canvas limit does not
 * produce a small PNG, it produces a blank one — so the sizes that cannot work
 * are kept out of the menu rather than offered and then failed. And a region is
 * a legal list of ISO codes and an illegal file name.
