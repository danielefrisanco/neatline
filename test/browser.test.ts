/**
 * The one thing in the runtime path that could not work in a browser.
 *
 * `loadWorld`, `loadOcean` and `loadCover` each built a URL and read it through
 * `node:fs/promises`, which is fine on disk and fatal in a page. They now share
 * one `readData` that asks the URL what it is: a `file:` URL is read, anything
 * else is fetched.
 *
 * **Asking rather than trying is the whole design, and the order is the reason.**
 * Node has had a global `fetch` since 18, so "try fetch, fall back to the
 * filesystem" would make every Node caller pay a failed request for a `file:`
 * URL before getting the answer. Branching on the protocol costs nothing and
 * cannot be wrong: a package on disk resolves `import.meta.url` to `file:`, and
 * a bundle served over HTTP resolves it to wherever it was served from.
 *
 * The other half of the claim — that the shipped bundle contains no live
 * `node:` import — is checked in `scripts/verify-exports.mjs`, because it is a
 * fact about `dist/` rather than about `src/`, and `dist/` is what a bundler
 * sees. It is also where the plan turned out to be wrong: a bundler does *not*
 * silently drop a lazy dynamic import.
