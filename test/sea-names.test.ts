/**
 * The names of seas, and whether they are on the sea.
 *
 * The rule the feature makes and the tests hold it to: **a sea is named when
 * its middle is on the map.** The anchor is computed once at build time as the
 * interior point furthest from that sea's own shore, because a centroid is not
 * good enough for the shapes worth naming — the Mediterranean's falls over
 * Sicily — and the polygon is then discarded, which is what keeps a hundred and
 * eighteen names down to 7 KB.
 *
 * So the assertion that matters is not that a `<text>` was emitted. It is that
 * putting the emitted coordinate back through `invert()` lands on water, and
 * that the whole word fits on the canvas rather than half of it.
