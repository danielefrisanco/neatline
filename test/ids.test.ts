/**
 * Two maps in one document.
 *
 * The stylesheets have been scoped to a hash of themselves since Phase 3, which
 * made it look as though two maps could already share a page. The *ids* were
 * constants — `mp-land-clip`, `mp-stripe`, `mp-relief` — and an `url(#…)`
 * resolves against the whole document, so every reference on the page found
 * whichever map the parser reached first. One map's rivers clipped to another
 * map's coastline, with nothing in either file to say so.
 *
 * The properties here are about the document rather than about the names: every
 * reference resolves, it resolves inside its own map, and no id is claimed
 * twice. That holds whatever the ids are called.
