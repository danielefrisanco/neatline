/**
 * The numbers on the grid, and the bug they uncovered on the way in.
 *
 * A graticule that draws its lines and does not say what any of them is, is
 * decoration rather than a reference — that was the gap. What made this worth
 * more than the feature is what writing a number at the end of every line
 * revealed: **the lines were not reaching the frame**. They were sampled across
 * the region's bounds plus a quarter, which is not what the canvas shows, so on
 * every conic they stopped a few units short of the edge. A faint line ending
 * just inside the frame looks like a faint line; a number that refuses to be
 * placed does not.
