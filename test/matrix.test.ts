/**
 * The cross product, as invariants rather than as pictures.
 *
 * Nine regions by five projections by five themes is 225 maps. Committing 225
 * SVG snapshots would mean nobody ever opens one, and a gallery nobody opens is
 * the exact failure this project has already had three times. So the gallery
 * stays curated and human-sized, and the combinations that no one will ever
 * look at are checked here for the things that can be stated as facts:
 *
 *   - it renders at all
 *   - it draws something
 *   - every number it emits is a number
 *   - what it draws is on the canvas
 *   - the same input gives the same output
 *   - every token the stylesheet asks for resolves to a value
 *
 * None of that proves a map is *good*. It proves a combination is not broken,
 * which is the only claim a matrix this size can honestly make.
