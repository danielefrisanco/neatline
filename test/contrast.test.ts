/**
 * A floor under how close two colours a map puts side by side may be.
 *
 * This exists because the preset tests only ever asked whether a token
 * *resolves*. Every one of them passed on a `sand` map where `--land-edge` was
 * set to the background colour exactly and the lightest band was four points
 * off it — so a low-value country on a coast had neither a fill nor an outline
 * dividing it from the sea, and Eritrea was simply not there. Nothing was
 * undefined. Nothing threw. The map was wrong.
 *
 * **The metric is perceptual difference, not luminance ratio.** The obvious
 * check — a WCAG contrast ratio — was tried first and rejected by measurement:
 * it scores `atlas` at 1.04, a failing grade, because atlas draws a warm tan
 * coastline on a cold blue sea at almost identical lightness. On screen that
 * coast is unmistakable; WCAG cannot see hue, and half the cartography here is
 * hue. ΔE (CIE76, in Lab) counts lightness, hue and chroma together, and it
 * sorts the presets the way an eye does:
 *
 *     contrast 92 · blueprint 64 · noir 28 · atlas 23 · moss 14
 *     ——— the floor ———
 *     dusk 8.7 · slate 5.9 · sand 5.8
 *
 * The three below the line all vanished when rendered and looked at; `moss`,
 * the weakest above it, is faint but legible. So the floor is set from `moss`
 * rather than from a round number: 10 is under every preset judged readable
 * and over every preset judged not.
