/**
 * Write the bundled themes, palettes and typefaces out as real `.css` files.
 *
 * They are authored as TypeScript strings so that `neatline()` stays isomorphic —
 * reading a stylesheet from disk at call time would make the library Node-only,
 * which is exactly the constraint Phase 4 is working to remove. But consumers
 * still want the plain files: to link one in a page, to fork one as a starting
 * point, or to let a bundler handle it. So the strings are the source and these
 * files are generated from them, rather than the two drifting apart.
