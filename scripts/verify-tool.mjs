/**
 * Prove the built site is complete before it is deployed.
 *
 * Run after `npm run tool:build`, and before the artifact is uploaded.
 *
 * The failure this exists for has a nasty shape: the tool loads, the form
 * works, and then a *later* request — for a file only fetched when someone
 * ticks a layer — comes back 404. Nothing at build time complains, because
 * Vite emitted a reference and a reference is all it promised. Whether the file
 * arrived is a separate question, and it is the one nobody asks until a person
 * is looking at a broken page.
 *
 * So: every asset the page names must exist, and the map data must be among
 * them. `.nojekyll` is checked too, because one of Vite's own chunk names
 * begins with a double underscore and Jekyll deletes those without a word.
