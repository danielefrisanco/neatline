/**
 * Vendor the Natural Earth sources that no npm package carries.
 *
 * Countries, lakes and rivers arrive through `world-atlas` and `sane-topojson`,
 * which are devDependencies and need no help. Everything else this library
 * draws — populated places, land cover, sea names — exists only as a file on
 * Natural Earth's servers, so it is downloaded once, trimmed, and committed
 * under `vendor/`. `build-data.mjs` reads what lands here; nothing at runtime
 * does. Run this only when a source changes:
 *
 *     node scripts/fetch-natural-earth.mjs
 *
 * **Trimmed on the way in, not on the way out.** A Natural Earth GeoJSON
 * carries about thirty `name_xx` translation columns and a `wikidataid` on
 * every feature, and the physical-region files carry every continent as a
 * polygon. Vendoring them whole would put roughly five megabytes in git to
 * ship a hundred kilobytes, so the download keeps the columns the build reads
 * and drops the rest. What is vendored is what will be used.
 *
 * **The land-cover classification only exists at 10m, and that is the one
 * interesting thing here.** `geography_regions_polys` is the source for desert
 * and mountain cover, and Natural Earth publishes it at three tiers — but the
 * `FEATURECLA` column is populated at 10m only. At 50m and 110m it is blank on
 * every single feature, so those files are a list of named shapes with no way
 * to tell the Sahara from Scandinavia. The classification is recoverable
 * because `NE_ID` is stable across tiers: joining the 10m table onto the
 * coarser geometry matches 60 of 60 features at 110m and 522 of 522 at 50m.
 * The class still comes from Natural Earth. Nothing here guesses at a name.
 *
 * Everything Natural Earth publishes is public domain.
