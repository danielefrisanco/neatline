/**
 * Build the bundled map data.
 *
 * Phase 4's real job is not "add more layers" — it is to stop reading a
 * devDependency off disk at call time, which is what made the library
 * Node-only. Sources are devDependencies and stay on the build machine;
 * `data/` is what ships and what `loadWorld()` reads.
 *
 * Three sources, each chosen for one reason:
 *   world-atlas     countries, because it carries ISO numeric ids that the
 *                   identity table already maps
 *   sane-topojson   lakes and rivers, which world-atlas does not have
 *   Natural Earth   populated places, land cover and sea names, vendored under
 *                   vendor/ by scripts/fetch-natural-earth.mjs
 *
 * Countries stay as a topology: shared borders can only be derived where arcs
 * are shared. Water needs no such thing — no two lakes share an edge — so it is
 * decoded to plain geometry, which is smaller and simpler to read back.
 *
 * The ocean is written to a file of its own rather than into the bundle, and
 * that is the whole reason it can exist at all. It is one polygon with a hole
 * for every continent, so it costs 74 KB at 110m and 985 KB at 50m — roughly
 * half again the size of everything else put together. `sea` is opt-in, and
 * an opt-in layer that every caller downloads is not opt-in. The loading seam
 * has been async and swappable since Phase 4 precisely so a layer could move
 * out of the bundle like this without reaching a caller.
 *
 * Land cover follows the ocean out for the same reason and sea names do not,
 * which is the line worth stating once: **weight decides, not opt-in-ness.**
 * Cover is 47 KB at 110m and 470 KB at 50m of polygon, so it gets its own file.
 * Sea names are 2 KB and 7 KB, because the polygons were reduced to one anchor
 * point each before they were ever vendored — a list that small is cheaper in
 * the bundle than a second network round trip would be, and it rides along.
