 * And that the shipped bundle can be built for a browser at all.
 *
 * This is checked here rather than in the test suite because it is a claim
 * about `dist/`, not about `src/` — and `dist/` is what a bundler will see.
 *
 * The plan said the library's `node:fs` imports were "lazy, on paths the tool
 * never takes, so a bundler drops all three". **That was never true and this is
 * how it was found.** A bundler does not drop a dynamic import — it has to
 * resolve it, and esbuild targeting a browser failed outright with "Could not
 * resolve". Two things were wrong underneath: tsup was stripping the `node:`
 * prefix, which is the only thing that tells a bundler the name is a builtin
 * rather than a package to go and find, and nothing told it what to do with the
 * builtin once named. The prefix is kept now, and the `browser` field maps it
 * to an empty module — so a browser build resolves it, never executes it
 * (`readData` branches on the URL protocol first), and Node is untouched.
