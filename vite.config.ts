 * The base path, and the trap it exists to spring early.
 *
 * A GitHub *project* site is served from `/neatline/`, not from `/`. That one
 * segment is the whole reason 09b deploys a page that does almost nothing: if
 * the base is wrong the map does not fail loudly — it asks for a file, gets the
 * 404 page, and reports a JSON parse error from three modules down.
 *
 * The dev server runs on the same base for the same reason. A local site served
 * from `/` and a deployed one served from `/neatline/` are not the same site,
 * and the difference should not first appear in an action log.

/**
 * Check that there is data to serve, and get out of the way.
 *
 * This started as a plugin that copied `data/` next to the bundle, on the
 * reasoning that the library resolves every file as `../data/<name>.json`
 * against `import.meta.url`. **That was unnecessary, and the build said so:**
 * Vite recognises `new URL(\`../data/${name}.json\`, import.meta.url)` even with
 * a variable in it, globs the directory at build time, and rewrites the whole
 * construction into a lookup of hashed asset URLs. The copy was three and a
 * half megabytes of duplicate.
 *
 * So the plugin's job is the part Vite cannot do: say something useful when
 * `data/` is missing. Vite's glob over an empty directory produces an empty
 * lookup and no error at all — the failure surfaces much later, in a browser,
 * as `undefined` where a URL should be.
 *
 * Worth knowing before swapping bundlers: this rewriting is a Vite behaviour,
 * not a guarantee. The library asks for a plain relative URL and works without
 * it — that is what `readData` is for — but a bundler that leaves the URL alone
 * needs `data/` deployed beside the bundle.
