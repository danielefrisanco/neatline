/**
 * The token vocabulary.
 *
 * Named by role, never by appearance: `--ink`, never `--dark-gray`. A token
 * called `--dark-gray` is a lie the moment someone writes a dark theme, and
 * renaming it later breaks every theme in the wild.
 *
 * Reserved tokens are part of the vocabulary from v1 and simply unused. A theme
 * can set them today and they will start doing something when their layer
 * arrives, which is cheaper than asking every theme to be revised then.
