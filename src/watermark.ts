 * A watermark: a wordmark or a logo, stamped on the canvas.

 * **This is attribution, not protection.** A watermark on an SVG is a node in a
 * file the reader can open, select and delete — it marks provenance and it
 * cannot enforce anything. Nothing here is a rights mechanism, and a caller who
 * needs one needs something other than a vector graphic. It exists for the same
 * reason `credit` does: a map that leaves a browser as a file has no
 * surrounding page to carry a mark, so the mark has to come out of the
 * generator or it does not exist.
 *
 * Placed in `.mp-furniture` like the rest, which puts it above every geographic
 * layer. A wordmark under the map would be a texture; over it, it is a stamp.
