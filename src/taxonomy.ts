/**
 * The class taxonomy — the real public API.
 *
 * A theme is a stylesheet, so every selector anyone ever writes is a promise
 * this project makes. These names are versioned like a function signature and
 * change only on a major. The order of `LAYERS` is the paint order, and it is
 * part of that promise: a layer inserted between two existing ones would
 * silently restack every theme in the wild, so all twelve slots are emitted from
 * v1 onward, empty where the feature does not exist yet.
 *
 * The graticule and land cover were both reserved before anyone asked for
 * them, and that is the whole point. A graticule sits at the very bottom — the
 * grid the world is drawn on, which land covers. Land cover sits directly above
 * the land it tints and below the water, because a river runs over a desert.
 * Both are placements that can only be made once: adding either after 1.0 would
 * restack everything above it. The graticule filled its slot in Phase 8d and
 * land cover filled its own in 8e, neither of them moving a single line of
 * anyone's stylesheet — which is exactly what reserving them bought. Eleven of
 * the twelve slots now carry something; `roads` is the last one still waiting,
 * and it is waiting on data rather than on a decision.
 *
 * Layers are plural (`.mp-land`), features are singular (`.mp-country`).
 *
 * Every layer but the last is geographic: its contents move when the projection
 * or the region changes. `furniture` is the exception — a credit line or a
 * watermark is placed on the *canvas*, in fixed user units, and must not shift
 * when the camera does. That difference is why it is a layer of its own rather
 * than a kind of annotation.
