/**
 * Text on a map, placed honestly.
 *
 * This is the weakest part of drawing a map as an SVG and the part to scope
 * plainly rather than oversell. There is no label-placement solver here — no
 * search over candidate positions, no relaxation, nothing that moves a label
 * twice. What there is instead is a fit test, one sideways step, and a greedy
 * first-come pass that hides whatever still lands on something already placed.
 * Every one of those is a single deterministic decision per label, and none of
 * them can produce a different map on a second run.
 *
 * The decisions, in the order they are made.
 *
 * The anchor is the balance point of the country's *largest ring that is on
 * the canvas*, not the centroid of its whole geometry. A country is often
 * several pieces, and France's geometry reaches French Guiana — the same fact
 * that once made France the frontmost country in Europe for prism sorting.
 * Averaging all of it puts "France" in the Atlantic.
 *
 * When that balance point falls outside the country — which is what happens to
 * every crescent, every archipelago spine, every Croatia — it is replaced by
 * the deepest interior point, found by refining a grid. This is what the plan
 * called a curated table of thirty hand-tuned anchors; the geometry knows the
 * answer, and unlike a table it cannot go stale when the source data does.
 *
 * The fit test compares the width the name needs against the width the country
 * actually has at that point, breaking the name over two lines if that is what
 * makes it fit.
 *
 * Then names are laid down in order of importance, and any that lands on one
 * already down is marked `data-fit="0"`. Nothing is moved to make room and
 * nothing is retried, which is what keeps this from being a solver: the world
 * has some two hundred capitals and a world map has room for perhaps thirty,
 * so the question is only which thirty.
 *
 * Nothing is ever dropped from the document. Every name is written out, and
 * `data-fit="0"` is hidden by a stylesheet rule the theme can turn off — the
 * library's job is to state facts, and a poster map may well want all of them.
 */

 * Average glyph advance as a fraction of the font size.

 * SVG has no measuring API outside a browser and this library has no font
 * metrics, so the fit test estimates. 0.58 is close for the sans and serif
