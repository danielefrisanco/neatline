/**
 * Editorial colour, in the manner of a geopolitical review.
 *
 * The four palettes that came before it are all atlas-muted, which suits a
 * reference map and does not suit a page someone is meant to stop at. This one
 * is the opposite bargain: flat saturated plates — brick red and ochre against
 * olive and deep teal — with the linework nearly black, the way a printed
 * political review draws a map that has to carry an argument across a spread.
 *
 * The sea is the dark half here, which is the one structural consequence worth
 * knowing about: `--furniture-ink` and `--sea-ink` are *light*, because a
 * credit line and the name of a gulf are both set on the water. Every other
 * palette can take its furniture ink straight from its muted ink; this one
 * cannot, and a dark credit on this sea is invisible.
 *
 * `--fill-6` is a sage green and not a blue, for the same reason the atlas
 * theme has no blue plate: on a map with a sea this colour a blue country
 * reads as water.
