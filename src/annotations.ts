 * arriving as three different vocabularies. So `at` is a coordinate, in
 * lon/lat, and everything else is composition on top of it.
 *
 * Deliberately *not* a coordinate in pixels. A pixel is only meaningful for
 * the exact region, projection and canvas size that produced it; the same map
 * at another size puts that pixel on different ground. `invert()` exists to
 * turn a pointer's pixel into a coordinate precisely so that what gets stored
 * here is the coordinate.
 *
 * Annotations are excluded from the camera, for the same reason `neighbours`
 * is: placing a mark must never move the map out from under the marks already
 * placed. A pin outside the frame stays outside the frame.

/**
 * Build the arrows.
 *
 * The first primitive with two coordinates instead of one, and it is drawn only
 * when both survive. Half an arrow is not a partial answer — it is a line
 * pointing at somewhere the reader was never told about, which is worse than
 * nothing at all. So `from` and `to` go through the same resolver a pin's `at`
 * does, and either one failing drops the pair.
 *
 * A curve rather than a straight line because two places on a map usually have
 * something between them: a straight chord runs through whatever is in the way
 * and reads as a border or a route. A bow says "from here to there" without
 * claiming a path, and its sign is the side it bows to, so a caller can flip one
 * off a coastline or out from under an arrow running the other way.
