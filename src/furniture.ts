 * The furniture layer — everything placed on the canvas rather than on the map.
 *
 * This is the one layer that is not geographic, and the anchor is what makes it
 * so. Every other layer moves when the projection or the region changes,
 * because everything in it is somewhere on the ground. A credit line, a
 * watermark, a legend and a scale bar are on the *paper*: they belong to one of
 * nine positions on the canvas, in fixed user units, and must not shift when the
 * camera does.
 *
 * So the anchor is to this layer what `at` is to the annotations — the one
 * decision the rest of the layer copies. A watermark, a legend, a scale bar and
 * a north arrow all have to answer *where on the canvas*, and they will all
 * answer it this way.
