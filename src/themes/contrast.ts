/**
 * Pure black and white, sized for legibility rather than for elegance.
 *
 * Every choice here is the accessible one: no muted ink, because a secondary
 * grey is the first thing to fail a contrast check; heavy boundaries, because
 * a hairline disappears when a map is printed or projected; larger labels than
 * any other preset. Its bands and political fills are steps of grey with wide
 * gaps between them, so they stay distinguishable in greyscale, at low
 * resolution, and to a reader with any form of colour blindness.
 *
 * The one thing black and white cannot express is a filled lake, which would
 * read as a hole punched in the land — so lakes are drawn as outlines instead,
 * the only structural override any bundled theme needs.
 *
 * The sea is a light grey rather than white. Pure white on both sides of the
 * coastline leaves land and water telling apart only by which side of a line
 * they fall on, which is exactly the reading this theme exists to spare
 * someone. The grey is not doing the work — the black coastline is, at 21:1
 * against either — but it removes the ambiguity for nothing.
