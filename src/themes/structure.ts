/**
 * The structure every bundled theme shares.
 *
 * A theme is meant to be colour and weight, not layout logic, and five themes
 * repeating the same forty rules is five places for them to drift. So the rules
 * live here once and read entirely from tokens — a theme supplies values, and
 * anything genuinely structural about it goes in `extra`.
 *
 * That constraint is also what makes palettes worth having: because every
 * width, dash and hue arrives through a custom property, a palette can restyle
 * a map without knowing a single selector.
 *
 * One rule of the lighting model is enforced by the palettes rather than here:
 * a prism's wall is in shadow, so `--prism-side` has to be darker than any
 * band that can sit on top of it. A pale wall under a dark band inverts the
 * light source, and a choropleth prism map turns to mud.
 *
 * The highlighted wall is `--accent-side` and not `brightness()` on the accent
 * for the usual reason: a CSS filter function is not a value SVG 1.1 accepts,
 * so every viewer that ignores stylesheets drew the wall in the same colour as
 * the top and flattened the prism into a silhouette.
 *
 * The same reason rules out `calc()` anywhere here. Flattening substitutes
 * custom properties but does not evaluate arithmetic, so a settlement name set
 * in `calc(var(--label-size) * 0.8)` would export as that string in a
 * `font-size` attribute, which is not a length. Hence `--place-label-size` is
 * a token of its own rather than a fraction of another.

 * so highlight is written last and takes it. Before this was settled,
 * highlighting a country on a choropleth silently returned its band colour.

/*
 * The annotation layer.

 * stack, the tracking and the casing — the halo is the whole difference
 * between a name that reads over a coastline and one that dissolves into it,
 * and a class of its own would have had to restate all of it. It is set at the
 * settlement size and bold: an annotation is the point of the map, so it
 * out-ranks a city name drawn at the same size.
 *
 * It is deliberately NOT filled with --anno-ink, which is the obvious guess
 * and would be invisible. Every bundled preset sets --anno-ink to the same
 * value as --label-halo — white on minimal and contrast, #F2EAD8 on atlas,
 * #0B0E11 on noir — because what it was authored to mean is the ink drawn on
 * top of a mark, legible against --anno. Filling text with it and casing that
 * text in --label-halo paints white on white. So it stays reserved until a
 * callout has a box to put ink inside, and a pin's label takes --ink, like
 * every other name on the map.
 */
/*
 * The mark is cased, and it has to be. Every bundled preset sets --anno to the
 * same value as --accent — deliberately, so a marked map and a highlighted one
 * agree — which means a pin dropped on a highlighted country is drawn in the
 * country's own colour and disappears. That is not a hypothetical: a region,
 * a highlight and a marker is the map this whole layer exists to make.
 *
 * So the mark gets the same casing its label gets, from the same two tokens.
 * A pin then reads against any ground the map can put under it, including an
 * accent-coloured country, and the mark and the word beside it are separated
 * from the map in the same way rather than in two different ways.
