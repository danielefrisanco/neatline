# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are recorded here.

Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/);
versioning follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

**Pre-1.0 policy.** While on `0.x`, the minor bump carries breaking changes and
the patch bump carries everything else — the public API is not yet stable.
`1.0.0` is Phase 7, and from there normal semver applies.

**The class taxonomy is public API.** Renaming or reordering a class, a data
attribute, or a token is a breaking change, exactly like changing a function
signature — themes in the wild depend on those names.

## [Unreleased]

Phase 2 — class taxonomy and the node-tree emitter.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-08-27

Phase 1 — geometry core. `mapper()` now produces real maps.

### Added

- Region resolvers: presets, code lists, bounding boxes. Presets are saved
  code lists rather than a separate mechanism, and are explicit because the
  topology carries no continent field and because membership is an editorial
  call — "Western Europe" has no single correct definition
- Projection registry as a lookup table: `mercator`, `conic-conformal`,
  `albers`, `equal-earth`, `orthographic`. Conic standard parallels are derived
  from the region's latitude span, so a conic works anywhere without the caller
  knowing what a parallel is
- `fitExtent` camera, coordinate rounding via `geoPath.digits(1)`
- `map.project([lon, lat])` — the hook the annotation layer will hang from
- Country identity: alpha-2, ISO numeric and user-assigned codes all resolve to
  one canonical id, emitted as `data-iso`
- `isoTable()` publishing every accepted code
- Highlighting via `highlight: ["FR"]`, emitted as `.is-highlighted`
- Unrecognised codes throw rather than silently producing an empty map

### Changed

- **`mapper()` is now async.** The full dataset is 8 MB across detail tiers, so
  geometry has to be loaded per region rather than bundled wholesale. Deciding
  this now avoids a breaking change later
- Dropped the Phase 0 tests that asserted the absence of geometry

### Fixed

- **Framing no longer includes overseas territories.** France governs French
  Guiana, so its geometry reaches South America; fitting to raw bounds framed
  the Atlantic and squashed Europe into a corner. Outlying pieces are rejected
  by angular distance from the region's centre — not by area, since Guyane is
  13% of France and an area threshold would never catch it. A safety valve
  leaves genuinely dispersed regions (Oceania, the world) untouched

### Decided

- **Outlying pieces are dropped from the output, not just the camera** — a map
  of France is continental France. This is a default, not a statement about
  what belongs to whom: Guyane is France. Representing overseas territories
  properly, with insets or an explicit opt-in, is planned work
- **ISO codes are the canonical id, not the topology's numeric.** Five features
  (Kosovo, Somaliland, N. Cyprus, Indian Ocean Ter., Siachen Glacier) ship with
  no id at all, so "fall back to the number" had nothing to fall back to. They
  get user-assigned codes from the `X` range ISO reserves for private use —
  `XK`, `XS`, `XN`, `XI`, `XG`. These are ours, not ISO, and are flagged as
  such in `isoTable()`

### Known

- `world-atlas` is a devDependency and geometry is read from disk, so the
  library is Node-only until Phase 4 bundles per-region extracts. The seam is
  isolated in `src/topology.ts`
- Regions are drawn without surrounding context — a West Europe map ends at the
  German border rather than fading into Poland. Context is a Phase 2 question

## [0.0.1] — 2026-08-27

Phase 0 — scaffold. No geometry yet; the package builds, tests, and imports.

### Added

- npm package with dual ESM/CJS output via `exports`, types emitted for both
- Runtime dependencies pinned to exactly two: `d3-geo`, `topojson-client`
- TypeScript strict, plus `noUncheckedIndexedAccess` for the coordinate work
  ahead. `lib` excludes DOM on purpose, so the emitter cannot reach for
  `document` and break under Node
- Public type surface settled in `src/types.ts` — regions, projections, detail
  tiers, render options, `MapResult`. Every option is plain, JSON-serialisable
  data; no callbacks anywhere, which is what will let an editor UI drive the
  same API later
- `mapper()` stub emitting a valid, correctly sized, empty document
- vitest with SVG file snapshots — snapshots land in `test/__snapshots__/` as
  real `.svg` files that open in a browser, so geometry regressions are visible
  rather than a string diff
- Two tests asserting Phase 0's *boundaries* (no `<path>` emitted, `project()`
  still deferred), so scope creep fails loudly
- `scripts/verify-exports.mjs` — imports the built artifacts under both module
  systems and calls them
- `npm run check`: typecheck → test → build → verify exports

### Decided

- **npm, not pnpm.** pnpm is not installed on the dev machine and there is no
  workspace to gain from it. One command to switch if that changes.
- **No default export.** Mixing it with named exports forces CJS consumers to
  write `.default`; the API is `mapper({...})` regardless.
- **Snapshots as `.svg` files** rather than `.snap`, for a library whose output
  is meant to be looked at.

### Known

- The npm name `mapper` is taken (v0.2.5), as is `svg-mapper`. A real name is
  needed before `1.0.0`; a scoped name is the zero-effort fallback. Nothing is
  blocked until publish.
- One `low` audit advisory remains in the esbuild dev-server chain —
  Windows-only, dev-server-only, devDependency, never reaching consumers.
  `npm audit fix` does not resolve it.

## Planned
