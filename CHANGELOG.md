# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are recorded here.

Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/);
versioning follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

**Pre-1.0 policy.** While on `0.x`, the minor bump carries breaking changes and
the patch bump carries everything else — the public API is not yet stable.
`1.0.0` is Phase 7, and from there normal semver applies.

**The class taxonomy is public API.** Renaming or reordering a class, a data
attribute, or a token is a breaking change, exactly like changing a function
signature — themes in the wild depend on those names.

## [Unreleased]

Phase 1 — geometry core. Region resolvers, the projection lookup table, the
`fitExtent` camera, coordinate rounding, and `map.project()`.

## [0.0.1] — 2026-08-27

Phase 0 — scaffold. No geometry yet; the package builds, tests, and imports.

### Added

- npm package with dual ESM/CJS output via `exports`, types emitted for both
- Runtime dependencies pinned to exactly two: `d3-geo`, `topojson-client`
- TypeScript strict, plus `noUncheckedIndexedAccess` for the coordinate work
  ahead. `lib` excludes DOM on purpose, so the emitter cannot reach for
  `document` and break under Node
- Public type surface settled in `src/types.ts` — regions, projections, detail
  tiers, render options, `MapResult`. Every option is plain, JSON-serialisable
  data; no callbacks anywhere, which is what will let an editor UI drive the
  same API later
- `mapper()` stub emitting a valid, correctly sized, empty document
- vitest with SVG file snapshots — snapshots land in `test/__snapshots__/` as
  real `.svg` files that open in a browser, so geometry regressions are visible
  rather than a string diff
- Two tests asserting Phase 0's *boundaries* (no `<path>` emitted, `project()`
  still deferred), so scope creep fails loudly
- `scripts/verify-exports.mjs` — imports the built artifacts under both module
  systems and calls them
- `npm run check`: typecheck → test → build → verify exports

### Decided

- **npm, not pnpm.** pnpm is not installed on the dev machine and there is no
  workspace to gain from it. One command to switch if that changes.
- **No default export.** Mixing it with named exports forces CJS consumers to
  write `.default`; the API is `mapper({...})` regardless.
- **Snapshots as `.svg` files** rather than `.snap`, for a library whose output
  is meant to be looked at.

### Known

- The npm name `mapper` is taken (v0.2.5), as is `svg-mapper`. A real name is
  needed before `1.0.0`; a scoped name is the zero-effort fallback. Nothing is
  blocked until publish.
- One `low` audit advisory remains in the esbuild dev-server chain —
  Windows-only, dev-server-only, devDependency, never reaching consumers.
  `npm audit fix` does not resolve it.

## Planned

Version targets for the remaining phases, so the roadmap and the release
history stay the same document.
